description: "Potential future developments for ACK-ID and the agent identity ecosystem."
---

ACK-ID provides a standards-based framework for managing agent identities, with a particular focus on enabling secure and compliant commerce. By leveraging DIDs and VCs, it establishes verifiable links between agents and their owners, facilitating trust in automated interactions.

Establishing verifiable ownership is a crucial first step, but a complete understanding of an agent's trustworthiness involves more dynamic factors. Future development within the broader ecosystem will likely focus on standardizing aspects like **agent reputation, reliability metrics** (e.g., success/error rates), and **ethical compliance attestations**. This will allow interacting parties to not only verify who owns an agent, but also to assess an agent's performance and trustworthiness over time.

ACK-ID provides a foundation upon which these richer, dynamic reputation systems can be built, enabling more nuanced trust decisions in the agent economy.
