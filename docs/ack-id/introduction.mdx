In the emerging agent economy, establishing who an AI agent is — and what person or business is responsible for it — is critical for trust, security, and compliant commerce. Agent Commerce Kit's Identity protocol (ACK-ID) defines a way to securely and verifiably establish the identities of agents and link them to their human or organizational owners.

ACK-ID addresses key challenges in agent identity:

- **Verifiable Ownership:** Creating clear, auditable links between legal entities and the autonomous agents acting on their behalf.
- **Secure Authentication:** Enabling agents to securely prove their identity to other parties in automated interactions.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Allowing agents to share necessary identity attributes for compliance or authorization while preserving privacy.

Essentially, ACK-ID helps answer two fundamental questions for participants in agentic workflows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Can I Trust an AI?">
    As a service provider (or another agent), how can I trust that the AI
    interacting with me is legitimate, authorized, and represents who it claims
    to represent?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Can I Prove I am a Trustworthy AI?">
    As an agent owner or operator, how can my AI agent prove its identity and
    its authority to act on my behalf in a secure, standard way?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

ACK-ID addresses these questions by applying open standards for digital identity in a pattern specifically designed for agentic systems. ACK-ID uses and builds upon decentralized identity protocols because they enable entities to control their own digital identifiers rather than rely on central authorities, and that level of identity management is a necessity for AI agent workflows.

<Info>
  Trust in AI is not a one-and-done decision. Trust may change over time based
  on an agent's behavior, its owner's changes in status, reputational factors,
  and more.
