ACK-Pay provides a flexible and robust pattern framework for agentic financial transactions. By defining standard interactions and leveraging Verifiable Credentials for receipts, it enables secure, automated, and compliant payments across diverse systems.

Its support for both [server-initiated](/ack-pay/server-initiated-sequence) and [client-initiated](/ack-pay/client-initiated-sequence) flows, coupled with the abstraction provided by [Payment Services](/ack-pay/payment-service), allows integration with various settlement rails. These include traditional finance, card networks (potentially via APIs like Stripe, PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, etc.), and blockchain-based digital assets (including via protocols like x402).

When combined with [ACK-ID](/ack-id/introduction), ACK-Pay creates a powerful foundation for trust and accountability when executing payments in the emerging agent economy.
