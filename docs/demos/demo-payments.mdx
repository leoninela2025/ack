## Overview

**ACK-Pay** is a protocol built on W3C Standards designed to facilitate secure, verifiable, and interoperable financial transactions among autonomous agents, services, and human participants.

This interactive command-line demo illustrates the [**Server-Initiated payment flow**](/ack-pay/server-initiated-sequence), including:

- A **Client Agent** attempting to access a protected resource.
- A **Server Agent** issuing a Payment Request.
- The Client making a payment.
- A **Receipt Service** verifying the payment and issuing a receipt (in the form of a Verifiable Credential).
- Client using the receipt to access the protected resource.

```

Alternatively, run from within the demo directory (`./demos/payments`):

```sh
pnpm start
```

## ACK-Pay Demo Components

- **Client**: The interactive agent requesting access to resources and making payments.
- **Server**: An HTTP server protecting resources and issuing payment requests.
- **Receipt Service**: HTTP service validating payments and issuing verifiable receipts (VCs).
- **Payment Service** (illustrated in optional paths): Handles credit card payments, currency conversion, compliance checks (KYC/AML), and complex payment routing.

## Demo Walkthrough

The interactive CLI guides you through these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Resource Request">
Client requests access to a protected resource. Server responds with an HTTP `402 Payment Required` status containing a `PaymentRequest`.
</Step>

<Step title="Making Payment">
  Client performs an on-chain stablecoin (USDC) payment to the Serverâ€™s wallet
  on Base Sepolia testnet. Alternatively, a credit card payment can be handled
  via a Payment Service.
</Step>

<Step title="Receipt Request">
  After payment completion, Client requests a receipt (VC) from the Receipt
  Service by providing proof of payment.
</Step>

<Step title="Receipt Verification">
  Receipt Service verifies provided transaction details and issues a Receipt
  Credential.
</Step>

<Step title="Accessing the Resource">
  Client retries accessing the resource, presenting the receipt to the Server.
  Server verifies receipt authenticity and grants resource access.
</Step>
</Steps>
