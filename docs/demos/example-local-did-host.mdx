title: Local DID Host Example
description: "An example of how to serve did:web documents locally for ACK development."
---

## Overview

The **local-did-host** is a simple [Hono](https://hono.dev) server designed to serve `did:web` documents locally, which is useful for local development.

The server dynamically serves `.well-known/did.json` routes, enabling local testing and development of DID documents. It supports subpaths for multiple identities, such as `/agent/.well-known/did.json` and `/controller/.well-known/did.json`, served by default at `0.0.0.0:3458`.

The DID Documents created here are dynamic and intended only for development purposes. Static serving is more appropriate for production.

## Installation and Setup

Generate private keys for local identities.

From within the example directory (e.g., from project root: `./examples/local-did-host`) execute the setup:

```sh
pnpm run setup
```

## Running the Server

Start the local server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

The server is accessible at: [http://0.0.0.0:3458](http://0.0.0.0:3458)

## Available Identities

Default served identities:

| Entity       | DID URI                             | Resolved URL                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent`      | did\:web:0.0.0.0%3A3458\:agent      | [http://0.0.0.0:3458/agent/.well-known/did.json](http://0.0.0.0:3458/agent/.well-known/did.json)           |
| `controller` | did\:web:0.0.0.0%3A3458\:controller | [http://0.0.0.0:3458/controller/.well-known/did.json](http://0.0.0.0:3458/controller/.well-known/did.json) |

## How `did:web` Resolution Works

Resolving a `did:web` DID involves fetching `.well-known/did.json` from the indicated domain or subpath. Examples:

- `did:web:example.com` resolves to `https://example.com/.well-known/did.json`
- `did:web:example.com:special` resolves to `https://example.com/special/.well-known/did.json`
