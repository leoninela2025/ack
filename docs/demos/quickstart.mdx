This guide helps you rapidly set up your local environment, clone the repository, and start running interactive demos and examples for the **Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22.x or later recommended)
- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing pnpm

ACK uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management. If you're running Node.js v22.x or later, you can install and manage `pnpm` easily using Node's built-in `corepack`:

```sh
corepack enable
```

Now, running any subsequent `pnpm` command will automatically install the correct version.

## Clone the Repository

Clone the ACK repository locally using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agentcommercekit/ack.git
cd ack
```

## Set Up Your Local Environment

From the repository root, run the following command to install dependencies and set up local environment variables:

```sh
pnpm run setup
```

This prepares your system to run ACK demos and examples.

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
These demos use testnet environments and example API keys. **They are strictly for educational and development purposes and must not be used in production environments.**

Always handle your API keys securely and responsibly, and never expose sensitive information publicly.

</Warning>
