## Overview

This example demonstrates how to run a simple Credential Verifier server, which is useful for local development and testing credential verification.

## Installation and Setup

To prepare the environment and install dependencies, run the setup from within the verifier example directory (e.g., from project root: `./examples/verifier`):

```sh
pnpm run setup
```

## Running the Server

Start the Credential Verifier server locally:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

This will launch the verifier server, ready for local credential verification operations.
