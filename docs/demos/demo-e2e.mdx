title: End-to-End Demo
description: "Comprehensive example demonstrating combined ACK-ID and ACK-Pay protocol flows."
---

## Overview

This End-to-End (E2E) demo showcases the integration and seamless interaction between ACK's core protocols:

- **ACK-ID** (Identity Management)
- **ACK-Pay** (Payment Processing)

Through this interactive command-line demo, you'll observe a realistic flow demonstrating secure agent identity verification alongside automated, verifiable payment transactions.

## Getting Started

Before running this demo, please complete the setup steps from the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart).

## Running the Demo

You can run the E2E demo using the following command from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm demo:e2e
```

Alternatively, navigate directly into the demo directory (`./demos/e2e`) and run:

```sh
pnpm start
```

## Demo Overview

The demo walks you through a scenario where:

<Steps>
<Step title="Agent Initialization">
Agents (Client and Server) and their respective owners initialize their identities using ACK-ID standards (Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials).
</Step>

<Step title="Identity Verification">
  Client Agent and Server Agent verify each other's identities securely and
  efficiently before initiating transactions (utilizing ACK-ID).
</Step>

<Step title="Payment Request">
  Server Agent requires payment from the Client Agent (utilizing ACK-Pay),
  issuing a formal Payment Request specifying acceptable payment methods.
</Step>

<Step title="Payment Execution">
  Client Agent completes the payment transaction, showcasing automated payment
  verification.
</Step>

<Step title="Receipt Issuance and Verification">
  Upon successful payment, a receipt Service issues a cryptographically
  verifiable receipt.
</Step>

<Step title="Resource Access">
Using the receipt, the Client Agent successfully accesses the requested resource from the Server Agent.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Components Demonstrated

- Integrated Identity Verification (ACK-ID)
- Payment Initiation, Processing, and Receipt Verification (ACK-Pay)
- Secure Agent-to-Agent interaction with cryptographic validation
