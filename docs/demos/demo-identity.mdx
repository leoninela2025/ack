title: ACK-ID Agent Demo
description: "Detailed step-by-step guide demonstrating ACK-ID identity verification between agents."
---

## Overview

**ACK-ID** is a protocol built on W3C Standards designed to ensure verifiable, secure, and compliant identity, reputation, and service discovery for autonomous agents.

This interactive command-line demo guides you through:

- **Owner Identity Creation**: Establish unique decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for entities (individuals or organizations) that offer AI agents.
- **Agent Identity Creation**: Assign distinct DIDs to AI agents, linked to their respective owners.
- **Verifiable Credential (VC) Issuance**: Generate digitally signed, tamper-proof credentials proving agent ownership.
- **Agent-to-Agent Verification**: Demonstrate secure verification of agent identities before or during interactions.

## Getting Started

Before running this demo, follow the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart) to ensure you are set up properly.

This demo requires either an Anthropic API key or an OpenAI API key.

You may set them in your `<root>/demos/identity/.env` file:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

## Running the Demo

Execute the following from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm run demo:identity
```

Alternatively, from within the demo directory (`./demos/identity`):

```sh
pnpm start
```

## Demo Walkthrough

The interactive CLI guides you through these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Agent Setup">
Two agents (Client and Server) and their "Owners" are created, each with their own public/private keypairs. DIDs represent their public keys, and each Agent DID points to its Owner.
</Step>

<Step title="Ownership Proof">
  Owners issue Verifiable Credentials (`ControllerCredential`) asserting their
  control over their respective agents.
</Step>

<Step title="Communication Initiation">
  Client and Server Agents start HTTP servers. The Client attempts
  communication; the Server demands identity verification first.
</Step>

<Step title="DID Exchange">
  The Server requests the Client's DID (`did:web:...`) for verification.
</Step>

<Step title="Identity Verification">
  Server performs a DID lookup, finds the Client's service endpoint, and
  privately requests the `ControllerCredential`. The Server verifies these
  credentials.
</Step>

<Step title="Interaction Fulfillment">
After verification, the Server fulfills the Client's initial request.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example DID Methods Supported

ACK-ID supports multiple DID resolution methods, notably:

- **did\:web**: Web-hosted DID Documents secured via SSL (e.g., `did:web:catenalabs.com`).
- **did\:key**: DID Documents with embedded public keys (e.g., `did:key:zQ3shg46zUAV...`). No key rotation supported.
- **did\:pkh**: Uses blockchain addresses (e.g., `did:pkh:eip155:84532:0xED89...`). No key rotation supported.

## DID Documents Explained

DID Documents broadcast public keys and essential metadata:

### Minimal `did:key` Document Example:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:key:zQ3shg46zUAV...",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:key:zQ3shg46zUAV...#jwk-1",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:key:zQ3shg46zUAV...",
      "publicKeyJwk": { "kty": "EC", "crv": "secp256k1" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Complete `did:web` Document Example:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:web:agent.example.com",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:web:agent.example.com#jwk-1",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:web:agent.example.com",
      "publicKeyJwk": { "kty": "EC", "crv": "secp256k1" }
    }
  ],
  "controller": "did:key:zQ3shg46zUAV...",
  "service": [
    {
      "id": "did:web:agent.example.com/v1/messages",
      "type": "MessagingEndpoint",
      "serviceEndpoint": "http://agent.example.com/v1/messages"
    },
    {
      "id": "did:web:agent.example.com/identity",
      "type": "IdentityService",
      "serviceEndpoint": "http://agent.example.com/identity"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: DID methods must support custom attributes for enhanced DID Documents (e.g., `did:web`). Methods like `did:key` and `did:pkh` are more restrictive.
