Interactive demos and their source code serve to illustrate core patterns of the **Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)**. Each demo has a dedicated detailed walkthrough to guide exploration.

We recommend running these demos from the project root, but you can also run each directly from its specific demo directory using `pnpm start`.
