This interactive demo will guide you through the fundamental concepts of ACK-ID.  We'll demonstrate how to establish verifiable identities for AI agents and their owners, and how agents can securely verify each other's identities before interacting.

ACK-ID uses well-established ${colors.bold("W3C Standards")} to provide secure, verifiable identity to AI agents. Using ${colors.bold("Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)")} and ${colors.bold("Verifiable Credentials (VCs)")}, agents can prove their identity and provide provable claims of their capabilities and authorized access.
